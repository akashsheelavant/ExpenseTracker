# ExpenseTracker
This project demonstrates SwiftUI along with SwiftData. 

This project is an expense tracker app. At its core this is an app with a form (how much did you spend?) and a list (here are the amounts you spent).
We can filter out the expenses to display either all, personal or business expenses. 
A custom sort can be applied to sort the list either by name or by amount of expenses.
